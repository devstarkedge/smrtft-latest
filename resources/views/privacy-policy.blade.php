                    <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                    <h4>These Terms were last revised on May 18, 2020.</h4>
                    <p>By accessing or using www.scholarships.africa or our mobile application (we use the term “app” to refer to our website and mobile app), you agree and intend to be legally bound by this Privacy Policy, including any changes that may be posted on the app from time to time. You should not use the app if you have any objections to any of these practices or terms.</p>

                    <h4>Information you provide about yourself</h4>
                    <p>When you “sign up” or create an account on the app, you provide us, at a minimum, with your first and last names, email address, phone number, certain information regarding your identity, and interests, and a password. This is information that can be uniquely identified with you or provide access to your account. Also, you may also provide us with additional personally identifiable information through notes that you leave with us. We will keep all of this information private, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <h4>Information we collect</h4>
                    <p>We keep track of most of the actions you take on the app. Additionally, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, including cookies.</p>
                    <p>When you access the app from a computer, mobile phone, or other devices, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.</p>
                    <p>We may use web tokens and “cookies” (small pieces of code or data we transmit to or store for an extended period of time on your browser, computer, mobile phone, or other devices) to make the app easier to use, to make our communications better, and to protect both you and the app. You can remove or block web tokens and cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the app. </p>

                    <h4>How we protect information</h4>
                    <h5>1. Steps we take to keep your information secure.</h5>
                    <p class="no-space">. We utilize third-party security infrastructure (website/application hosting, database management, cloud servers) that is consistent with commercially reasonable practices in the United States and the United Kingdom. We have implemented technical and organizational measures that we believe will ensure a level of data security appropriate to the risk and severity of disclosure, taking into account the state of the art in the United States and the United Kingdom, the costs of implementation and the stage of our company, and the nature, scope, context, and purpose of our obtaining and using your information. We provide access security solely by providing you with access to and use of the app through a combination of usernames and passwords. We also may use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit the use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Terms of Service. But you you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.</p>
                    <h5>2. Risks inherent in sharing information</h5>
                    <p class="no-space">Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on the app, including personally identifiable information, will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the app or that we use or have implemented.</p>
                     <p class="no-space">You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.</p>       
                     <p class="no-space">You understand that the app and your data may be compromised. While the app uses industry-standard systems to support the app, like any technology, the app may fail to function, become inoperative or inaccessible, produce errors, or lose, compromise, corrupt or inaccurately report data. We make no warranties concerning the app or its performance or security.</p>
                     <p class="no-space">You understand that the app may experience a security intrusion or data breach. As above, while the app uses industry-standard systems to secure the app and your data, like any technology, the app may experience a security intrusion or data breach.</p>

These purposes may include, among others, producing market research reports or providing dashboard database access for third party market research.</p>
                     <h5>2. To offer joint services, we may provide services or offers jointly with other companies or organizations.</h5>

This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities.
